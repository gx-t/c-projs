>&#13;As described above in the <A
HREF="sec-treeview-col-utf8-pango.html"
>"GtkCellRendererText, UTF8, and pango markup" section</A
>,
all strings that are to be displayed in the tree view need to be encoded
in UTF8 encoding. All ASCII strings are valid UTF8, but as soon as non-ASCII
characters are used, things get a bit tricky and the character encoding matters.
</P
><P
>&#13;Comparing two ASCII strings ignoring the case is trivial and can be done
using <TT
CLASS="literal"
>g_ascii_strcasecmp</TT
>, for example. <TT
CLASS="literal"
>strcasecmp</TT
>
will usually do the same, only that it is also locale-aware to some extent.
The only problem is that a lot of users use locale character encodings that
are not UTF8, so <TT
CLASS="literal"
>strcasecmp</TT
> does not take us very far.
</P
><P
>&#13;<TT
CLASS="literal"
>g_utf8_collate</TT
> will compare two strings in UTF8 encoding,
but it does not ignore the case. In order to achieve at least half-way correct
linguistic case-insensitive sorting, we need to take a two-step approach.
For example, we could use <TT
CLASS="literal"
>g_utf8_casefold</TT
> to convert the
strings to compare into a form that is independent of case, and then use
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>g_utf8_collate</TT
> to compare those two strings (note that the
strings returned by <TT
CLASS="literal"
>g_utf8_casefold</TT
> will not resemble the
original string in any recognisable way; they will work fine for comparisons
though). Alternatively, one could use <TT
CLASS="literal"
>g_utf8_strdown</TT
>
on both strings and then compare the results again with
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>g_utf8_collate</TT
>.
</P
><P
>&#13;Obviously, all this is not going to be very fast, and adds up if you have a
lot of rows. To speed things up, you can create a 'collation key' with
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>g_utf8_collate_key</TT
> and store that in your model as
well. A collation key is just a string that does not mean anything to
us, but can be used with <TT
CLASS="literal"
>strcmp</TT
> for string comparison
purposes (which is a lot faster than <TT
CLASS="literal"
>g_utf8_collate</TT
>).
</P
><P
>&#13;It should be noted that the way <TT
CLASS="literal"
>g_utf8_collate</TT
> sorts
is dependent on the current locale. Make sure you are not working in the
'C' locale (=default, none specified) before you are wondering about weird
sorting orders. Check with 'echo $LANG' on a command line what you current
locale is set to.
